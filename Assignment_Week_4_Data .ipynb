This defines the scope of this project, which is confined to the city of Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of the country of Malaysia in South East Asia. Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighborhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data. Venue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighborhoods.\nThis Wikipedia page with the  link showing as below: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_Kuala_Lumpur), contains a list of neighborhoods in Kuala Lumpur, with a total of 70 neighborhoods. We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautiful soup packages. Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighborhoods. After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest databases of 105+ million places and is used by over 125,000 developers. Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium). In the next section, we will present the Methodology section where we will discuss the steps taken in this project,\nthe data analysis that we did and the machine learning technique that was used."
